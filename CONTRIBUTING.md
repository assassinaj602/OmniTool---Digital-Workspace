## 🎨 Code Style & Standards

*   **Framework:** We use React 19 functional components with Hooks.
*   **Language:** Strict TypeScript. No `any` unless absolutely necessary.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS. 
    *   Use utility classes over custom CSS.
    *   Use `dark:` modifiers for dark mode compatibility.
*   **Typography:** 
    *   Use `font-heading` for titles (Satoshi).
    *   Use `font-sans` for UI (Inter).
    *   Use `font-mono` for technical data (JetBrains Mono).
*   **Icons:** Use the `Icons.tsx` component library.

## 🧪 Testing
Since this is a client-side tool, manual testing is crucial:
*   Test with large files.
*   Test on mobile devices (responsive design).
*   Test in Dark Mode.
